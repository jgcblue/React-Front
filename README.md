# MY NOTES:

This code is a powerful demonstration of state-of-the-art web development technologies, showcasing a robust and interactive application. It's built with React, a leading JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Bootstrap, the go-to toolkit for creating responsive and mobile-first websites.

The code includes a variety of components such as `LoginWrapper` and `CoverLettersWrapper`, which handle user authentication and display cover letters, respectively. It uses the `react-pdf` library to manage PDF files, demonstrating the application's capability to work with complex document formats.

The application harnesses the power of `axios`, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. This allows the application to make asynchronous requests to servers, enabling it to fetch, display, and interact with data from various sources seamlessly.

The code also incorporates `AceEditor`, a high-performance code editor for the web. The Application has a feature that allows users to write or edit code directly in the browser, a powerful feature for any web-based development environment.

The use of `AOS`, a small library to animate elements on your page as you scroll, indicates that this application prioritizes user experience and interactivity. 

Finally, the application uses `ReactMarkdown`, a markdown component for React. This means the application can take text input in the markdown format and render it as proper HTML, providing a user-friendly way to format text.

In summary, this code represents a highly interactive, feature-rich web application that leverages some of the best libraries and tools available in modern web development. It's a testament to what can be achieved with the right tools and a clear vision.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
